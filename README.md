# Description

Samp Front is a basic starter landing page template for [SA:MP](https://www.sa-mp.com/) communities related websites. It's always better to craft your stuff from scratch, however, for the oblivious, it's life-saving to have a starter prototype filling your hands at your debut.
Of course, Samp Front can be customized to meet your needs, that's the reason for affixing it with the word “template”. However, note that the credits should remain untouched so that the contributors are at least acknowledged.

# Setup

The installation is pretty easy, navigate to the config folder, there you'll find a file named `config.ini`, open it up on edit mode and tweaks the settings in there to your liking, then simply save it and the website will reflect those changes.
As for the logo, replace the `logo.png` file that's located under `public/assets/img`.

**NOTE**: In order for the live update to work properly, you have to have both Search Results
